Use the customer unique identifier. Clearly define how to calculate Recency based on the latest purchase timestamp and specify the criteria for classifying RFM segments. The average sales should be computed as the total spend divided by the total number of orders. Please analyze and report the differences in average sales across the RFM segments\"\nevidence = \"# Introduction to the RFM Model\n\nThe RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) model segments and scores customers based on three key dimensions:\n\n\u2022 Recency (R): How long it has been since the customer\u2019s last purchase. A lower R score (e.g., R = 1) indicates a very recent purchase, while a higher R score (e.g., R = 5) indicates a longer time since the last purchase.\n\n\u2022 Frequency (F): How often the customer purchases within a given time period. A lower F score (e.g., F = 1) signifies that the customer buys very frequently, whereas a higher F score (e.g., F = 5) indicates less frequent purchasing.\n\n\u2022 Monetary (M): The total amount of money the customer spends. A lower M score (e.g., M = 1) indicates higher overall spending, while a higher M score (e.g., M = 5) signifies lower spending over the measured period.\n\nEach customer\u2019s R, F, and M scores are determined by their respective percentiles when compared to other customers. By concatenating the three scores, you get an \u201cRFM cell\u201d\u2014for instance, a customer with R=1, F=5, and M=2 would fall into the 152 segment.\n\n# RFM Segmentation Calculation\n\nAfter scoring customers on Recency, Frequency, and Monetary values, the next step is to group them into segments that require different marketing or sales strategies. Typically:\n\n1. Determine each customer\u2019s recency score (R) from 1 to 5 (1 = very recent purchase, 5 = not recent).  \n2. Determine each customer\u2019s frequency score (F) from 1 to 5 (1 = most frequent purchases, 5 = least frequent).  \n3. Determine each customer\u2019s monetary score (M) from 1 to 5 (1 = highest spending, 5 = lowest spending).  \n4. Concatenate these three scores into an RFM score (e.g., 153, 514).\n\nBy analyzing the distribution of RFM scores and placing them into buckets\u2014for example, \u201cChampions,\u201d \u201cLoyal Customers,\u201d \u201cAt Risk,\u201d \u201cLost,\u201d etc.\u2014you can tailor marketing, sales, and retention strategies to maximize the potential of each segment. \n\nFor instance, a \u201cChampion\u201d (R=1, F=1, M=1) is a recent, frequent, and high-spending user who is highly valuable to your business, whereas a \u201cLost\u201d customer (e.g., R=5, F=5, M=5) may require re-engagement offers or might no longer be cost-effective to target. Different segments can thus be prioritized based on their profitability and likelihood of responding positively to marketing efforts.\n\n## RFM Segmentation Logic\n\nCustomers are assigned to specific segments (RFM Buckets) based on a combination of their Recency, Frequency, and Monetary scores. The segmentation logic is as follows:\n\n- **Champions**: Customers who have made a recent purchase, with high frequency and high monetary value. These are considered the most valuable customers.\n  - Criteria: Recency = 1 and Frequency + Monetary score between 1 and 4.\n\n- **Can't Lose Them**: Previously frequent and high-spending customers who have not made a recent purchase. These customers are at risk of leaving and need attention.\n  - Criteria: Recency = 4 or 5 and Frequency + Monetary score between 1 and 2.\n\n- **Hibernating**: Customers whose last purchase was a while ago, with low to moderate frequency and spending. These customers might have lost interest in the products.\n  - Criteria: Recency = 4 or 5 and Frequency + Monetary score between 3 and 6.\n\n- **Lost**: Customers who have not purchased in a long time and have low frequency and monetary value. These customers are likely lost.\n  - Criteria: Recency = 4 or 5 and Frequency + Monetary score between 7 and 10.\n\n- **Loyal Customers**: Customers who are frequent buyers with decent spending levels, and they have made a purchase relatively recently. These customers are likely to be very loyal.\n  - Criteria: Recency = 2 or 3 and Frequency + Monetary score between 1 and 4.\n\n- **Needs Attention**: Customers whose purchase frequency and spending are moderate. They haven't bought very recently, but they could be incentivized to become more active.\n  - Criteria: Recency = 3 and Frequency + Monetary score between 5 and 6.\n\n- **Recent Users**: Customers who made a purchase recently, but their frequency and spending are moderate. These are relatively new or inconsistent buyers.\n  - Criteria: Recency = 1 and Frequency + Monetary score between 7 and 8.\n\n- **Potential Loyalists**: Customers who show potential to become loyal customers. They have good frequency and monetary scores, and they have made recent purchases. With the right engagement, they could become loyal customers.\n  - Criteria:\n    - Recency = 1 and Frequency + Monetary score between 5 and 6.\n    - OR Recency = 2 and Frequency + Monetary score between 5 and 8.\n\n- **Price Sensitive**: Customers who have made recent purchases but tend to spend less, indicating they may be more sensitive to price.\n  - Criteria: Recency = 1 and Frequency + Monetary score between 9 and 10.\n\n- **Promising**: These customers exhibit high potential with decent frequency and monetary scores, and they could become more valuable over time.\n  - Criteria: Recency = 2 and Frequency + Monetary score between 9 and 10.\n\n- **About to Sleep**: Customers whose frequency and spending are low, and their last purchase was some time ago. These customers are likely to become inactive.\n  - Criteria: Recency = 3 and Frequency + Monetary score between 7 and 10.\n\n## Summary\n\nThis segmentation logic groups customers based on their behavior in terms of when they last purchased (Recency), how often they purchase (Frequency), and how much they spend (Monetary). By understanding which group a customer belongs to, organizations can tailor marketing strategies to engage the right audience more effectively, improving customer retention and maximizing value.\n\"\n```SR\ndf1 = df.where(element = olist_orders.order_status, filter = 'delivered')\ndf2 = df1.orderby(by = olist_orders.order_purchase_timestamp, desc).limit(1)\ndf3 = df2.groupby(olist_customers.customer_unique_id).agg(sum(olist_order_payments.payment_value) / count(olist_orders.order_id))\nres = df3.select(df3.customer_unique_id, df3.sum(olist_order_payments.payment_value) / df3.count(olist_orders.order_id))\n```\n\nNow generate the valid SQL:\n```sqlite\n[Your Answer]\n```"}

The calculation is based on the Haversine formula, which is commonly used to find the shortest distance between two points on a sphere given their latitude and longitude. This method is especially useful for determining flight distances between airports located in different cities around the world.\n\n## City and Coordinate Extraction\n\nFor each flight, the following data is obtained:\n\n- **Departure city** (referred to as `from_city`) and its geographical coordinates (longitude and latitude).\n- **Arrival city** (referred to as `to_city`) and its geographical coordinates (longitude and latitude).\n\nThe coordinates are extracted as decimal values, with longitude and latitude represented in degrees. This ensures that trigonometric operations can be applied during the distance calculation.\n\n## Haversine Formula\n\nThe Haversine formula is used to calculate the great-circle distance between two points on a sphere using their latitude and longitude. The formula is given as:\n\n\\[\nd = 2r \\cdot \\arcsin\\left(\\sqrt{\\sin^2\\left(\\frac{\\Delta \\phi}{2}\\right) + \\cos(\\phi_1) \\cdot \\cos(\\phi_2) \\cdot \\sin^2\\left(\\frac{\\Delta \\lambda}{2}\\right)}\\right)\n\\]\n\nWhere:\n\n- \\( d \\) is the distance between the two points (in kilometers).\n- \\( r \\) is the radius of the Earth (approximately 6371 km).\n- \\( \\phi_1 \\) and \\( \\phi_2 \\) are the latitudes of the departure and arrival points, respectively, in radians.\n- \\( \\Delta \\phi = \\phi_2 - \\phi_1 \\) is the difference in latitudes.\n- \\( \\lambda_1 \\) and \\( \\lambda_2 \\) are the longitudes of the departure and arrival points, respectively, in radians.\n- \\( \\Delta \\lambda = \\lambda_2 - \\lambda_1 \\) is the difference in longitudes.\n\n### Conversion to Radians\n\nSince the input coordinates are in degrees, they must be converted to radians before applying the Haversine formula. This conversion is done using the formula:\n\n\\[\n\\text{radians} = \\text{degrees} \\times \\frac{\\pi}{180}\n\\]\n\n## Symmetry of Routes\n\nTo identify unique flight routes between two cities, we standardize the order of cities in each route. Specifically, we ensure that the lexicographically smaller city name is always listed as the first city (`city1`), and the larger city is listed as the second city (`city2`). This ensures that a flight from City A to City B is treated the same as a flight from City B to City A.\n\n## Average Route Distance\n\nOnce the distances for all flights between two cities are computed, the average distance for each city pair is calculated by summing the distances and dividing by the total number of flights between those cities:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Average Distance} = \\frac{\\sum \\text{Flight Distances}}{\\text{Number of Flights}}\n\\]\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThis method of flight route distance calculation provides a reliable way to determine the great-circle distance between cities based on the coordinates of their respective airports. The use of the Haversine formula ensures accurate results for distances on the Earth's surface, making it ideal for aviation and travel analysis.\n\"\n```SR\ndf1 = df.where(element = airports_data.city, filter = 'Abakan')\ndf2 = df.where(element = airports_data.city, filter = 'Abakan')\ndf3 = df1.union(df2)\nres = df3.select(airports_data.coordinates).apply(haversine, airports_data.coordinates)\n```\n\nNow generate the valid SQL:\n```sqlite\n[Your Answer]\n```"}

The use of the Haversine formula ensures accurate results for distances on the Earth's surface, making it ideal for aviation and travel analysis.\n\"\n```SR\ndf1 = df.groupby(airports_data.city, airports_data.city).agg(avg_distance = avg(flights.distance))\ndf2 = df1.groupby(avg_distance).count()\ndf3 = df2.orderby(by = count(airports_data.city), asc).limit(1)\nres = df3.select(count(airports_data.city))\n```\n\nNow generate the valid SQL:\n```sqlite\n[Your Answer]\n```"}

A higher batting average indicates a more consistent and successful batsman.\n- Batting Average = Total Runs \u00f7 Total Dismissals\n\n## Strike Rate\n- In batting, strike rate indicates the scoring rate of a batsman, showing the average number of runs scored per 100 balls faced. A higher strike rate reflects an aggressive and fast-scoring batsman.\n- Strike Rate = (Total Runs \u00f7 Balls Faced) \u00d7 100\n\n## Wickets Taken\n- Wickets taken refers to the total number of times a bowler has successfully dismissed an opposing batsman. This statistic is a core measure of a bowler's effectiveness and impact on the game.\n\n## Economy Rate\n- Economy rate measures a bowler's efficiency by indicating the average number of runs conceded per over (6 balls) bowled. A lower economy rate shows greater control and efficiency in restricting the opposition's scoring.\n- Economy Rate = (Total Runs Conceded \u00f7 Balls Bowled) \u00d7 6\n\n## Wickets Taken\n- The number of times a bowler successfully dismisses a batsman in a single match.  This metric is a direct indicator of the bowler's effectiveness, showing how many players they were able to remove from play.\n\n## Runs Given\n- The total number of runs scored by the batting side off a particular bowler\u2019s deliveries in a single match.

T (Track) - Overtake under Normal Racing Conditions\nIf none of the above conditions apply, the overtake is categorized as **T (Track)**, meaning it occurred during normal racing conditions on the track, without any external factors like pit stops or retirements influencing the outcome. This is the default classification for overtakes that happen during regular competition.\n\n---\n\nThese classifications help to identify and record the context of each overtake with clarity, ensuring accurate representation of race dynamics.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"\n```SR\ndf1 = df.where(element = lap_positions.lap, filter = '<= 5')\ndf2 = df1.where(element = retirements.lap, filter = '<= 5')\ndf3 = df1.where(element = pit_stops.lap, filter = '<= 5')\ndf4 = df1.where(element = results.grid, filter = '<= 2')\ndf5 = df1.where(element = results.grid, filter = '> 2')\nres = df.select(df2.count(), df3.count(), df4.count(), df5.count())\n```\n\nNow generate the valid SQL:\n```sqlite\n[Your Answer]\n```"}
