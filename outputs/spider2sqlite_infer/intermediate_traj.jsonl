Use the customer unique identifier. Clearly define how to calculate Recency based on the latest purchase timestamp and specify the criteria for classifying RFM segments. The average sales should be computed as the total spend divided by the total number of orders. Please analyze and report the differences in average sales across the RFM segments\"\nevidence = \"# Introduction to the RFM Model\n\nThe RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) model segments and scores customers based on three key dimensions:\n\n\u2022 Recency (R): How long it has been since the customer\u2019s last purchase. A lower R score (e.g., R = 1) indicates a very recent purchase, while a higher R score (e.g., R = 5) indicates a longer time since the last purchase.\n\n\u2022 Frequency (F): How often the customer purchases within a given time period. A lower F score (e.g., F = 1) signifies that the customer buys very frequently, whereas a higher F score (e.g., F = 5) indicates less frequent purchasing.\n\n\u2022 Monetary (M): The total amount of money the customer spends. A lower M score (e.g., M = 1) indicates higher overall spending, while a higher M score (e.g., M = 5) signifies lower spending over the measured period.\n\nEach customer\u2019s R, F, and M scores are determined by their respective percentiles when compared to other customers. By concatenating the three scores, you get an \u201cRFM cell\u201d\u2014for instance, a customer with R=1, F=5, and M=2 would fall into the 152 segment.\n\n# RFM Segmentation Calculation\n\nAfter scoring customers on Recency, Frequency, and Monetary values, the next step is to group them into segments that require different marketing or sales strategies. Typically:\n\n1. Determine each customer\u2019s recency score (R) from 1 to 5 (1 = very recent purchase, 5 = not recent).  \n2. Determine each customer\u2019s frequency score (F) from 1 to 5 (1 = most frequent purchases, 5 = least frequent).  \n3. Determine each customer\u2019s monetary score (M) from 1 to 5 (1 = highest spending, 5 = lowest spending).  \n4. Concatenate these three scores into an RFM score (e.g., 153, 514).\n\nBy analyzing the distribution of RFM scores and placing them into buckets\u2014for example, \u201cChampions,\u201d \u201cLoyal Customers,\u201d \u201cAt Risk,\u201d \u201cLost,\u201d etc.\u2014you can tailor marketing, sales, and retention strategies to maximize the potential of each segment. \n\nFor instance, a \u201cChampion\u201d (R=1, F=1, M=1) is a recent, frequent, and high-spending user who is highly valuable to your business, whereas a \u201cLost\u201d customer (e.g., R=5, F=5, M=5) may require re-engagement offers or might no longer be cost-effective to target. Different segments can thus be prioritized based on their profitability and likelihood of responding positively to marketing efforts.\n\n## RFM Segmentation Logic\n\nCustomers are assigned to specific segments (RFM Buckets) based on a combination of their Recency, Frequency, and Monetary scores. The segmentation logic is as follows:\n\n- **Champions**: Customers who have made a recent purchase, with high frequency and high monetary value. These are considered the most valuable customers.\n  - Criteria: Recency = 1 and Frequency + Monetary score between 1 and 4.\n\n- **Can't Lose Them**: Previously frequent and high-spending customers who have not made a recent purchase. These customers are at risk of leaving and need attention.\n  - Criteria: Recency = 4 or 5 and Frequency + Monetary score between 1 and 2.\n\n- **Hibernating**: Customers whose last purchase was a while ago, with low to moderate frequency and spending. These customers might have lost interest in the products.\n  - Criteria: Recency = 4 or 5 and Frequency + Monetary score between 3 and 6.\n\n- **Lost**: Customers who have not purchased in a long time and have low frequency and monetary value. These customers are likely lost.\n  - Criteria: Recency = 4 or 5 and Frequency + Monetary score between 7 and 10.\n\n- **Loyal Customers**: Customers who are frequent buyers with decent spending levels, and they have made a purchase relatively recently. These customers are likely to be very loyal.\n  - Criteria: Recency = 2 or 3 and Frequency + Monetary score between 1 and 4.\n\n- **Needs Attention**: Customers whose purchase frequency and spending are moderate. They haven't bought very recently, but they could be incentivized to become more active.\n  - Criteria: Recency = 3 and Frequency + Monetary score between 5 and 6.\n\n- **Recent Users**: Customers who made a purchase recently, but their frequency and spending are moderate. These are relatively new or inconsistent buyers.\n  - Criteria: Recency = 1 and Frequency + Monetary score between 7 and 8.\n\n- **Potential Loyalists**: Customers who show potential to become loyal customers. They have good frequency and monetary scores, and they have made recent purchases. With the right engagement, they could become loyal customers.\n  - Criteria:\n    - Recency = 1 and Frequency + Monetary score between 5 and 6.\n    - OR Recency = 2 and Frequency + Monetary score between 5 and 8.\n\n- **Price Sensitive**: Customers who have made recent purchases but tend to spend less, indicating they may be more sensitive to price.\n  - Criteria: Recency = 1 and Frequency + Monetary score between 9 and 10.\n\n- **Promising**: These customers exhibit high potential with decent frequency and monetary scores, and they could become more valuable over time.\n  - Criteria: Recency = 2 and Frequency + Monetary score between 9 and 10.\n\n- **About to Sleep**: Customers whose frequency and spending are low, and their last purchase was some time ago. These customers are likely to become inactive.\n  - Criteria: Recency = 3 and Frequency + Monetary score between 7 and 10.\n\n## Summary\n\nThis segmentation logic groups customers based on their behavior in terms of when they last purchased (Recency), how often they purchase (Frequency), and how much they spend (Monetary). By understanding which group a customer belongs to, organizations can tailor marketing strategies to engage the right audience more effectively, improving customer retention and maximizing value.\n\"\n```Masked SR\ndf1 = df.where(element = [MASK], filter = '>= 2022-01-01')\ndf2 = df1.where(element = [MASK], filter = '< 2022-06-01')\nres = df2.select([MASK], [MASK])\n```\n\nNow, fill in the masked SR and give me the final SR:\n```SR\n[Your Answer]\n```", "response": "```SR\ndf1 = df.where(element = olist_orders.order_purchase_timestamp, filter = '>= 2022-01-01')\ndf2 = df1.where(element = olist_orders.order_purchase_timestamp, filter = '< 2022-06-01')\nres = df2.select(olist_customers.customer_unique_id, sum(olist_order_payments.payment_value) / count(olist_orders.order_id))\n```"}

The calculation is based on the Haversine formula, which is commonly used to find the shortest distance between two points on a sphere given their latitude and longitude. This method is especially useful for determining flight distances between airports located in different cities around the world.\n\n## City and Coordinate Extraction\n\nFor each flight, the following data is obtained:\n\n- **Departure city** (referred to as `from_city`) and its geographical coordinates (longitude and latitude).\n- **Arrival city** (referred to as `to_city`) and its geographical coordinates (longitude and latitude).\n\nThe coordinates are extracted as decimal values, with longitude and latitude represented in degrees. This ensures that trigonometric operations can be applied during the distance calculation.\n\n## Haversine Formula\n\nThe Haversine formula is used to calculate the great-circle distance between two points on a sphere using their latitude and longitude. The formula is given as:\n\n\\[\nd = 2r \\cdot \\arcsin\\left(\\sqrt{\\sin^2\\left(\\frac{\\Delta \\phi}{2}\\right) + \\cos(\\phi_1) \\cdot \\cos(\\phi_2) \\cdot \\sin^2\\left(\\frac{\\Delta \\lambda}{2}\\right)}\\right)\n\\]\n\nWhere:\n\n- \\( d \\) is the distance between the two points (in kilometers).\n- \\( r \\) is the radius of the Earth (approximately 6371 km).\n- \\( \\phi_1 \\) and \\( \\phi_2 \\) are the latitudes of the departure and arrival points, respectively, in radians.\n- \\( \\Delta \\phi = \\phi_2 - \\phi_1 \\) is the difference in latitudes.\n- \\( \\lambda_1 \\) and \\( \\lambda_2 \\) are the longitudes of the departure and arrival points, respectively, in radians.\n- \\( \\Delta \\lambda = \\lambda_2 - \\lambda_1 \\) is the difference in longitudes.\n\n### Conversion to Radians\n\nSince the input coordinates are in degrees, they must be converted to radians before applying the Haversine formula. This conversion is done using the formula:\n\n\\[\n\\text{radians} = \\text{degrees} \\times \\frac{\\pi}{180}\n\\]\n\n## Symmetry of Routes\n\nTo identify unique flight routes between two cities, we standardize the order of cities in each route. Specifically, we ensure that the lexicographically smaller city name is always listed as the first city (`city1`), and the larger city is listed as the second city (`city2`). This ensures that a flight from City A to City B is treated the same as a flight from City B to City A.\n\n## Average Route Distance\n\nOnce the distances for all flights between two cities are computed, the average distance for each city pair is calculated by summing the distances and dividing by the total number of flights between those cities:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Average Distance} = \\frac{\\sum \\text{Flight Distances}}{\\text{Number of Flights}}\n\\]\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThis method of flight route distance calculation provides a reliable way to determine the great-circle distance between cities based on the coordinates of their respective airports. The use of the Haversine formula ensures accurate results for distances on the Earth's surface, making it ideal for aviation and travel analysis.\n\"\n```Masked SR\n\n```\n\nNow, fill in the masked SR and give me the final SR:\n```SR\n[Your Answer]\n```", "response": "```SR\ndf1 = df.where(airports_data.city, filter = 'Abakan')\ndf2 = df.where(airports_data.city, filter = 'Abakan')\ndf3 = df1.intersect(df2)\ndf4 = df3.select(flights.flight_id)\ndf5 = df4.select(flights.actual_arrival).subtract(flights.actual_departure)\ndf6 = df5.select(flights.actual_arrival).subtract(flights.actual_departure)\nres = df6.max()\n```"}

2021 exchange rates, and finally averaging and listing them by month?\"\nevidence = \"## Projection Calculation Method\n\n### Steps for Projection Calculation\n\n1. **Aggregate Historical Sales Data**\n\n   - **Data Collection**: Gather sales data for products sold in France, including sales amounts each month for the years 2019, 2020, and 2021.\n   - **Summarize Sales**: Sum up the sales amounts for each product, country, month, and year.\n\n2. **Calculate Average Sales**\n\n   - **Monthly Averages**: Compute the average sales amount for each product and month across all available months to establish a baseline of typical sales.\n\n3. **Project Sales for 2021**\n\n   - **Identify Changes**: Determine how sales changed from 2019 to 2020 for each product and month. Calculate the percentage change in sales from 2019 to 2020.\n   - **Apply Changes**: Use this percentage change to estimate the sales for each month in 2021.\n\n   **Projection Formula**:\n   - For 2021:\n     - Calculate the difference in sales between 2020 and 2019.\n     - Compute the percentage change relative to 2019 sales.\n     - Apply this percentage change to the 2020 sales to estimate 2021 sales.\n     - The formula used in the SQL query is:\n\n       ```plaintext\n       (((Sales in 2020 - Sales in 2019) / Sales in 2019) * Sales in 2020) + Sales in 2020\n       ```\n\n     - This formula calculates the projected sales for 2021 based on the observed trend from 2019 to 2020.\n\n   - For other years (not 2021):\n     - Use the average sales value calculated for each month.\n\n4. **Adjust for Currency Conversion**\n\n   - **Conversion Rates**: Convert the projected sales figures into USD using monthly conversion rates.\n   - **Currency Adjustment**: Multiply the projected sales figures by the conversion rates to adjust to USD. If specific rates are not available, use a default rate of 1.\n\n5. **Calculate Monthly Averages in USD**\n\n   - **Monthly Projections**: Compute the average projected sales for each month in 2021, adjusting for currency conversion. Round the results to two decimal places.\n\n6. **Compile Results**\n\n   - **Organize Data**: Arrange the projected sales figures in a report, showing the estimated sales for each month in USD.\n\n### Summary\n\nThe projection calculation involves analyzing historical sales data from 2019 and 2020 to determine trends, applying these trends to estimate sales for 2021, and adjusting for currency differences. The result is a forecast of monthly sales in USD for 2021.\n\"\n```Masked SR\n\n```\n\nNow, fill in the masked SR and give me the final SR:\n```SR\n[Your Answer]\n```", "response": "```SR\ndf1 =

converting to USD based on the currency table, and then determining the monthly averages before finding their median?\"\nevidence = \"## Projection Calculation Method\n\n### Steps for Projection Calculation\n\n1. **Aggregate Historical Sales Data**\n\n   - **Data Collection**: Gather sales data for products sold in France, including sales amounts each month for the years 2019, 2020, and 2021.\n   - **Summarize Sales**: Sum up the sales amounts for each product, country, month, and year.\n\n2. **Calculate Average Sales**\n\n   - **Monthly Averages**: Compute the average sales amount for each product and month across all available months to establish a baseline of typical sales.\n\n3. **Project Sales for 2021**\n\n   - **Identify Changes**: Determine how sales changed from 2019 to 2020 for each product and month. Calculate the percentage change in sales from 2019 to 2020.\n   - **Apply Changes**: Use this percentage change to estimate the sales for each month in 2021.\n\n   **Projection Formula**:\n   - For 2021:\n     - Calculate the difference in sales between 2020 and 2019.\n     - Compute the percentage change relative to 2019 sales.\n     - Apply this percentage change to the 2020 sales to estimate 2021 sales.\n     - The formula used in the SQL query is:\n\n       ```plaintext\n       (((Sales in 2020 - Sales in 2019) / Sales in 2019) * Sales in 2020) + Sales in 2020\n       ```\n\n     - This formula calculates the projected sales for 2021 based on the observed trend from 2019 to 2020.\n\n   - For other years (not 2021):\n     - Use the average sales value calculated for each month.\n\n4. **Adjust for Currency Conversion**\n\n   - **Conversion Rates**: Convert the projected sales figures into USD using monthly conversion rates.\n   - **Currency Adjustment**: Multiply the projected sales figures by the conversion rates to adjust to USD. If specific rates are not available, use a default rate of 1.\n\n5. **Calculate Monthly Averages in USD**\n\n   - **Monthly Projections**: Compute the average projected sales for each month in 2021, adjusting for currency conversion. Round the results to two decimal places.\n\n6. **Compile Results**\n\n   - **Organize Data**: Arrange the projected sales figures in a report, showing the estimated sales for each month in USD.\n\n### Summary\n\nThe projection calculation involves analyzing historical sales data from 2019 and 2020 to determine trends, applying these trends to estimate sales for 2021, and adjusting for currency differences. The result is a forecast of monthly sales in USD for 2021.\n\"\n```Masked SR\n\n```\n\nNow, fill in the masked SR and give me the final SR:\n```SR\n[Your Answer]\n```", "response": "```SR\ndf1 =

Sales-to-CMA Ratio\n- **Definition**: This ratio compares actual sales to the centered moving average (CMA) of sales.\n- **Calculation**:\n  - **Centered Moving Average (CMA)**: The CMA is a smoothed value of sales calculated over a rolling 12-month period. It averages sales from the months before and after a given month, specifically using two overlapping windows (5 months before and 6 months after, and vice versa).\n  - **Sales-to-CMA Ratio**: The ratio is computed by dividing the actual sales amount for a month by its corresponding CMA value. A ratio greater than 2 indicates that the actual sales are more than twice the smoothed average for that period, suggesting significantly higher-than-average sales.\n\n## 2. 12-Month Overlapping Windows\n- **Definition**: A method to smooth sales data over time by averaging values in a specified window.\n- **Calculation**:\n  - **Window Size**: The window spans 12 months, with the specific approach involving overlapping periods. \n  - **First Window**: For a given month, this window includes 5 months before and 6 months after.\n  - **Second Window**: Another window includes 6 months before and 5 months after the given month.\n  - **Averaging**: Sales data is averaged over these two overlapping windows to compute the CMA. This method smooths out fluctuations by considering both the past and future sales in the calculation.\n\n## 3. Restriction to the 7th and 30th Months\n- **Definition**: A filter applied to focus calculations within a specific range of months.\n- **Calculation**:\n  - **Time Range**: Only the months between the 7th and 30th time steps (which correspond to specific periods) are considered for calculating the CMA and ratio.\n  - **Purpose**: This restriction is used to avoid edge effects in the data where the moving average might be less reliable (e.g., at the very beginning or end of the available data). By focusing on these months, the calculations are more stable and meaningful.\n\"\n```Masked SR\ndf1 = df.where(element = [MASK], filter = '>= 2016-01-01')\ndf2 = df1.select([MASK].product_id, [MASK].mth, [MASK].qty * 1.0 as qty)\ndf3 = df2.select([MASK].product_id, df2.mth, df2.qty, (cast(strftime('%Y', df2.mth), integer) - 2016) * 12 + cast(strftime('%m', df2.mth), integer) as t)\ndf4 = df3.window(partition_by = [MASK].product_id, order_by = [MASK].mth, rows_between = 5 preceding and 6 following).avg([MASK].qty)\ndf5 = df3.window(partition_by = [MASK].product_id, order_by = [MASK].mth, rows_between = 6 preceding and 5 following).avg([MASK].qty)\ndf6 = df3.select([MASK].product_id, [MASK].mth, [MASK].qty, (df4 + df5) / 2.0 as cma_qty)\ndf7 = df6.where(element = (df6.t), filter = 'between 7 and 30')\ndf8 = df7.select([MASK].product_id, [MASK].mth, [MASK].qty, df6.cma_qty, when(df6.cma_qty, is null or df6.cma_qty = 0, then = null).else = [MASK].qty / df6.cma_qty as sales_to_cma_ratio)\ndf3 = df.where(element = [MASK].mth, filter = '>= 2017-01-01').where(element = [MASK].mth, filter = '< 2018-01-01')\ndf4 = df3.groupby([MASK].id, [MASK].name).having(element = count(*), filter = '= 12').having(element = min([MASK].sales_to_cma_ratio), filter = '> 2.0')\nres = df4.select([MASK].id as product_id, [MASK].name as product_name)\n```\n\nNow, fill in the masked SR and give me the final SR:\n```SR\n[Your Answer]\n```", "response": "```SR\ndf1 = df.where(element = monthly_sales.mth, filter = '>= 2016-01-01')\ndf2 = df1.select(monthly_sales.product_id, monthly_sales.mth, monthly_sales.qty * 1.0 as qty)\ndf3 = df2.select(monthly_sales.product_id, df2.mth, df2.qty, (cast(strftime('%Y', df2.mth), integer) - 2016) * 12 + cast(strftime('%m', df2.mth), integer) as t)\ndf4 = df3.window(partition_by = monthly_sales.product_id, order_by = monthly_sales.mth, rows_between = 5 preceding and 6 following).avg(monthly_sales.qty)\ndf5 = df3.window(partition_by = monthly_sales.product_id, order_by = monthly_sales.mth, rows_between = 6 preceding and 5 following).avg(monthly_sales.qty)\ndf6 = df3.select(monthly_sales.product_id, monthly_sales.mth, monthly_sales.qty, (df4 + df5) / 2.0 as cma_qty)\ndf7 = df6.where(element = (df6.t), filter = 'between 7 and 30')\ndf8 = df7.select(monthly_sales.product_id, monthly_sales.mth, monthly_sales.qty, df6.cma_qty, when(df6.cma_qty, is null or df6.cma_qty = 0, then = null).else = monthly_sales.qty / df6.cma_qty as sales_to_cma_ratio)\ndf3 = df.where(element = monthly_sales.mth, filter = '>= 2017-01-01').where(element = monthly_sales.mth, filter = '< 2018-01-01')\ndf4 = df3.groupby(monthly_sales.product_id, products.name).having(element = count(*), filter = '= 12').having(element = min(monthly_sales.sales_to_cma_ratio), filter = '> 2.0')\nres = df4.select(monthly_sales.product_id as product_id, products.name as product_name)\n```"}

A ratio greater than 2 indicates that the actual sales are more than twice the smoothed average for that period, suggesting significantly higher-than-average sales.\n\n## 2. 12-Month Overlapping Windows\n- **Definition**: A method to smooth sales data over time by averaging values in a specified window.\n- **Calculation**:\n  - **Window Size**: The window spans 12 months, with the specific approach involving overlapping periods. \n  - **First Window**: For a given month, this window includes 5 months before and 6 months after.\n  - **Second Window**: Another window includes 6 months before and 5 months after the given month.\n  - **Averaging**: Sales data is averaged over these two overlapping windows to compute the CMA. This method smooths out fluctuations by considering both the past and future sales in the calculation.\n\n## 3. Restriction to the 7th and 30th Months\n- **Definition**: A filter applied to focus calculations within a specific range of months.\n- **Calculation**:\n  - **Time Range**: Only the months between the 7th and 30th time steps (which correspond to specific periods) are considered for calculating the CMA and ratio.\n  - **Purpose**: This restriction is used to avoid edge effects in the data where the moving average might be less reliable (e.g., at the very beginning or end of the available data). By focusing on these months, the calculations are more stable and meaningful.\n\"\n```Masked SR\ndf1 = df.where(element = [MASK], filter = '>= 2022-01-01')\ndf2 = df1.where(element = [MASK], filter = '< 2022-06-01')\nres = df2.select([MASK], [MASK])\n```\n\nNow, fill in the masked SR and give me the final SR:\n```SR\n[Your Answer]\n```", "response": "```SR\ndf1 = df.where(element = monthly_sales.mth, filter = '>= 2022-01-01')\ndf2 = df1.where(element = monthly_sales.mth, filter = '< 2022-06-01')\nres = df2.select(monthly_sales.product_id, monthly_sales.qty)\n```"}

specific conditions, reflecting the circumstances in which the overtaking occurred. Below are the classifications and their detailed explanations:\n\n## 1. R (Retirement) - Overtake during Retirement\nAn overtake is labeled as **R (Retirement)** if the overtaken driver retired on the same lap as the overtake. This indicates that the overtake occurred just before or during the overtaken driver's retirement, meaning they could no longer continue the race after that lap.\n\n## 2. P (Pit) - Overtake related to Pit Stops\nAn overtake is classified as **P (Pit)** under two scenarios:\n   - **Pit Entry**: If the overtake occurred while the overtaken driver was entering the pit lane, and the driver pitted on the same lap, it indicates that the overtaking happened due to the overtaken driver reducing speed to enter the pit lane.\n   - **Pit Exit**: If the overtake occurred as the overtaken driver was exiting the pit lane, especially if the driver pitted on the previous lap and the time gap between the drivers was less than a typical pit stop duration. This suggests that the overtake happened while the overtaken driver was potentially at a lower speed, rejoining the race track from the pit lane.\n\n## 3. S (Start) - Overtake at Race Start\nIf the overtake took place on the first lap of the race, and the two drivers were within two grid positions of each other at the start, the overtake is classified as **S (Start)**. This classification indicates that the overtake was part of the initial racing shuffle during the race's launch phase, where close position changes are common.\n\n## 4. T (Track) - Overtake under Normal Racing Conditions\nIf none of the above conditions apply, the overtake is categorized as **T (Track)**, meaning it occurred during normal racing conditions on the track, without any external factors like pit stops or retirements influencing the outcome.

It indicates that the table and column you could use in the SR.\n2. Highlighted Schema: a subset of Schema. You can consider it as a guess about the schema that used in the ground-truth SQL in the context of this text-to-SQL process. However, it is not always correct. It may contain irrelavant schema which could lead to errors in the subsequent SQL generation or miss truely related schema. \n3. Question: the natural language answer you need to answer in the text-to-SQL process\n4. Evidence: the oracle knowledge to help you generate the SR\n5. Masked SR: An SR with the schema masked, leaving only the reasoning steps in text-to-SQL.\nYour task is to refer to all the provided information and fill in the correct schema at the [MASK] positions in the masked SR.  The complete SR should accurately reflect the reasoning process that generates the SQL capable of correctly answering the question. \nDO NOT modify the logical template in the masked SR; you are only
