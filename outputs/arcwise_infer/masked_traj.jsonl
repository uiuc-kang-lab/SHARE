{"idx": 672, "prompt": "SR is a piece of pandas-like code, which is a intermediate representation between the natural language and SQL. I will provide you a piece of SR that show the logic of the text-to-SQL process in the context of the schema, question and evidence.\nYour task is to mask the schema (related tables and columns) in the SR and only keep the logic template. DO NOT modify the logic in the original SR, just do the mask.\nHere are some examples to help you better understand the task:\n\nHere is an example for you to understand the task\n======================= Example ===========================================\n```Input SR\ndf1 = df.where(element = Business_Hours.business_id, filter = 12)\ndf2 = df1.where(element = Days.day_of_week, filter = 'Monday')\nres = df2.select(Business_Hours.opening_time)\n```\n``` SR\ndf1 = df.where(element = [MASK], filter = 12)\ndf2 = df1.where(element = [MASK], filter = 'Monday')\nres = df2.select([MASK])\n```\n============================================================================\n\nNow mask the schema in the following SR and fill your answer in the template,\n```Input SR\ndf1 = df.where(element = card.type, filter = 'gold')\ndf2 = df1.where(element = disp.type, filter = 'OWNER')\nres = df2.select(client.client_id, cast((julianday('now') - julianday(client.birth_date), REAL) / 365.25, INTEGER) as age)\n```\n```SR\n[Your Answer]\n```", "response": "```sql\ndf1 = df.where(element = [MASK], filter = 'gold')\ndf2 = df1.where(element = [MASK], filter = 'OWNER')\nres = df2.select([MASK], cast((julianday('now') - julianday([MASK]), REAL) / 365.25, INTEGER) as age)\n```"}
